üöó Autonomous Vehicle Ethical Decision Simulator üöó

This project for CS 136 (Introduction to Data Structures) is a GUI-based simulation that models ethical decision-making in autonomous vehicles. Built using C++ and the Qt framework, the simulator allows users to define road conditions, environmental factors, and obstacles, then observes how the vehicle responds based on a simplified ethical framework.

üìÅ Project Overview üìÅ

- Team 2 Members:
  - Cristal Lara (Lead Developer)
    - Full development of the simulation software, including logic, UI, backend, and debugging.
    - Directed all programming decisions and implementation.
  - Cielito Fernandez
  - Oisin Kiely
  - Gang Li
  - Karmina Ramirez
- All remaining team members contributed to the project write-up, presentation preparation, and assisted with debugging.
- Language: C++
- Framework: Qt
- IDE Support: Visual Studio Code
- Key Classes:
  - MainWindow: Handles the GUI and simulation logic.
  - Vehicle: Tracks vehicle status (stop, slow down, continue).
  - DecisionMaker: Applies decision logic based on current conditions.
  - Logger: Logs the decisions for review.

üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions üõ†Ô∏è
1) Open Qt Creator
2) Go to "File > Open File or Project..."
3) Select the following file: "Autonomous Vehicle Simulator/CMakeLists.txt"
4) Choose a build location when prompted
5) Click the Run button or press Ctrl + R to build and execute the application

üì∑ Media Note üì∑

The animated GIF that visually represents the vehicle's movement is embedded in the application and plays automatically when the program starts.

‚ùó GIF Path Setup ‚ùó

If the application fails to load the GIF, it is likely due to a file path issue. The GIF is included in the zip file under "/Media/Pixel_Art_Car_Driving_A_Highway_At_Night.gif".

To resolve this, please do the following:
1) Open MainWindow.cpp
2) Locate this line: "movie = new QMovie("D:/Misc/College/Spring 2025/CS 136/SRC Project/Autonomous Vehicle Simulator/Media/Pixel_Art_Car_Driving_A_Highway_At_Night.gif");"
3) Update the path to match your system, such as: movie = new QMovie("YOUR/RELATIVE/PATH/TO/Media/Pixel_Art_Car_Driving_A_Highway_At_Night.gif");

Ensure that the Media folder is placed in the same directory as your .exe or project root, or adjust the path accordingly.
