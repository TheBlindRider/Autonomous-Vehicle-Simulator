/**
* For CS 136, this project explores how autonomous vehicles respond to various driving conditions by simulating ethical decision-making scenarios.
*
* This program allows users to input various driving conditions such as pedestrian presence and road obstacles.
* Additionally, the user may input the road type, weather, and speed limits.
* Based on these inputs, the system evaluates the safest and most ethical action for the vehicle to take.
* It will also follow a framework that prioritizes pedestrian safety and minimizes overall harm.
*
* Decisions are logged with timestamps and justifications based on ethical reasoning.
* This will allow users to review the vehicle's logic and behavior.
